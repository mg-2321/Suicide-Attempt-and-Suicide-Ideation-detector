# Suicide-Attempt-and-Suicide-Ideation-detector
Suicide Ideation (SI) that involves thoughts about comtemplation of suicide and Suicide Attempt (SA) which entails a deliberate action taken with the intent to end one's own life are suicidal behaviors need to be detected at early stages for effective treatment. Early detection of such behaviors can help medical professional provide proper medical tratement and monitor patient's health remotely through text.

The project aims to propose a Natural Language Processing model i.e. Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers using Suicide Attempt and Suicide Ideation Events(ScAN) dataset which contains 19k+ unique evidence suicide relevant annotations of 12K+ EHRs of 697 patient hospital-stays. There are 17,723 annotations for SA events and 1,967 annotations for SI events.

We acheived an accuracy pof 87% in detection of real-time implementation of SA and SI using BERT model.
